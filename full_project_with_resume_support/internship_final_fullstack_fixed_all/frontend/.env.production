# This .env file is optionally used during frontend build for production
# Since the frontend is served from the same domain as the backend,
# the API_BASE will default to the current domain with /api paths

# For this deployment setup (backend serving frontend), 
# the VITE_API_URL can remain unset and will default to /api
# This ensures the frontend communicates with the backend at the same domain
